# 2. 🛠️ Git Commands for Every Situation

Git features hundreds of commands, but for highly effective day-to-day work, you only need to master about 15-20 once you understand the underlying logic.

## 1. 🏎️ The Basic Workflow

1. `git status` — **The First Rule of Git**: If you're ever unsure of what to do next, run `git status`.
2. `git add <file>` — Moves changes from the Working Directory into the Staging Area.
3. `git commit -m "feat: description"` — Creates a permanent snapshot of the staged changes.
4. `git log --oneline --graph --all` — A powerful way to visualize your project's history.

## 2. 🚑 Fixing Mistakes (Undoing Actions)

### 2.1. Amend the Last Commit
`git commit --amend`
Allows you to add a forgotten file or fix a typo in the most recent commit message. Note that this changes the commit's hash!

### 2.2. Discard Changes in a File
`git restore <file>` (modern) or `git checkout -- <file>` (legacy).
Reverts a file back to its state in the last commit. All unsaved local changes will be permanently lost.

### 2.3. Reverting with Reset
- `--soft`: Removes the commit but **keeps your changes in the Staging Area**. Useful for "re-doing" a commit.
- `--mixed` (default): Removes the commit and the staging area entries, but keeps the files on your disk.
- `--hard`: **Deletes everything**. It removes the commit, clears the staging area, and deletes the actual file changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> `git reset --hard` is a destructive operation. Use it only if you are 101% certain you want to lose your work.

## 3. 🧭 Advanced Navigation

### 3.1. Reflog — The Time Machine
`git reflog`
Git records every change to the `HEAD` pointer. If you accidentally delete a branch or perform a `reset --hard` to the wrong place, `reflog` will show you the commit hash from before the error occurred. You can then use `git checkout <hash>` to recover your code.

### 3.2. Cherry-pick — Selective Copying
`git cherry-pick <hash>`
Allows you to copy one specific commit from any branch into your current active branch.

### 3.3. Stash — Temporary Storage
- `git stash`: "Pockets" your current uncommitted changes to give you a clean working directory.
- `git stash pop`: Brings those changes back.
Useful for when you need to switch branches urgently but aren't ready to commit your current work.

### 3.4. Bisect — Finding the Culprit
`git bisect`
A binary search tool used to find the specific commit that introduced a bug. You mark a "good" (working) commit and a "bad" (broken) commit, and Git guides you through the history until the source of the crash is identified.

# 4. ✍️ Git Best Practices

Mastering the commands is the foundation; using them with discipline and forethought is the sign of a truly professional software engineer.

## 🏗️ 1. Atomic Commits
A single commit should solve **exactly one** problem or implement one logical change.
- **Bad Practice**: A single massive commit affecting 50 files that fixes a bug, updates a library, and changes the UI layout.
- **Good Practice**: Three separate, small commits.
> [!TIP]
> Atomic commits are significantly easier to review, faster to revert if something breaks, and much easier to "cherry-pick" into other branches.

## 📝 2. Conventional Commits
Write your commit messages in a standardized way so that tools can automatically generate Changelogs and determine version bumps.

**The Template**: `type(scope): description`

- `feat:` — A new feature.
- `fix:` — A bug fix.
- `docs:` — Documentation-only changes.
- `refactor:` — Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `style:` — Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting).
- `chore:` — Updates to build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

## 🗄️ 3. Repository Hygiene (.gitignore)
Maintain a clean repository by never committing unnecessary or sensitive files:
- **Dependencies**: Folders like `node_modules` or `vendor`.
- **Secrets**: Files containing API keys or environment variables (`.env`).
- **IDE Metadata**: Local configuration files from VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.log`).

## 🚀 4. Professional Pro-Tips
- **Push Early, Push Often**: Do not hoard your code locally for a week. Pushing frequently allows colleagues to see your progress and helps avoid massive merge conflicts later.
- **Self-Review**: Before finalizing a commit or opening a Pull Request, run `git diff`. This is the best time to catch leftover `fmt.Println` debug statements or commented-out code.
- **Commit Squashing**: If you have a series of tiny commits like "fix typo" or "working...", use an interactive rebase (`rebase -i`) to "squash" them into a single, high-quality commit before merging into the main branch.

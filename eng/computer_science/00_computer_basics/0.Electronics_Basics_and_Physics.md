## 1. 🔌 Electricity and Signals

Electricity is the movement of electrons through a conductor. In computers, it is used to transmit signals.

### Basic Concepts

- **Voltage (V)**: The potential difference, or "pressure," that forces electrons to move (measured in volts).
- **Current (I)**: The flow of electrons (measured in amperes).
- **Resistance (R)**: The opposition to the flow of current (measured in ohms).

> [!NOTE]
> **Ohm's Law**: V = I × R. This fundamental law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

### Digital Signals

- Computers use **binary signals**: a high voltage level (typically 5V or 3.3V) represents **1**, while a low level (0V) represents **0**.
- **Analog signals** (continuous) in computers are converted into digital ones using an **ADC** (analog-to-digital converter).

        Continuous[Continuous<br/>3.7V, 2.1V, 4.5V...]
    end

```

> [!TIP]
> **Example**: In a USB connection, a 5V voltage is used to power devices, while data is transmitted through changes in voltage (signals).

## 2. 🧪 Semiconductors

Semiconductors are materials that can conduct electricity but not as efficiently as metals. They are crucial to electronics.

### Properties

- The primary material is **silicon** (Si), and sometimes germanium (Ge).
- Conductivity is regulated by adding impurities (**doping**):
  - **n-type**: Adding atoms with extra electrons (e.g., phosphorus).
  - **p-type**: Adding atoms with fewer electrons (e.g., boron).

### p-n Junction

Connecting n-type and p-type materials creates a **diode**—a device that allows current to flow in only one direction.

```mermaid

> [!NOTE]
> **Application**: Diodes in a computer's power supply convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).

## 3. 🔳 Transistors

A **transistor** is a key element of a computer, functioning as either a switch or an amplifier.

### Types of Transistors

- **BJT** (bipolar junction transistor): Controlled by current.
- **MOSFET** (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor): Controlled by voltage, used in most modern processors.

### How a MOSFET Works

- It has three terminals: **source**, **drain**, and **gate**.
- The voltage at the gate opens or closes a channel for current between the source and the drain.
- In digital circuits, a transistor is either "on" (**1**) or "off" (**0**).

```mermaid

    end
    
    style Off fill:#FF6B6B
    style On fill:#90EE90
```

### Role in Computers

- Transistors form **logic gates** (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).
- A single processor (e.g., Intel Core) contains billions of transistors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Within a processor, transistors switch **billions of times per second**, performing calculations. This is the foundation of all modern computers.

## 4. 🧩 Logic Gates

Logic gates are combinations of transistors that perform basic logic operations.

### Basic Gates

| Gate | Description | True if... |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AND** | Logical AND | All inputs are 1 |
| **OR** | Logical OR | At least one input is 1 |
| **NOT** | Logical NOT | Inverts the input (0 → 1, 1 → 0) |
| **NAND** | NOT-AND | Not all inputs are 1 |
| **NOR** | NOT-OR | All inputs are 0 |
| **XOR** | Exclusive OR | Only one input is 1 |

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Logic_Gates["Logic Gates from Transistors"]
        T1[Transistor 1] --> AND
        T2[Transistor 2] --> AND
        T3[Transistor 3] --> OR
        T4[Transistor 4] --> NOT
    end
    
    AND[AND Gate] --> Output1[Output: 1 only if both inputs are 1]
    OR[OR Gate] --> Output2[Output: 1 if any input is 1]
    NOT[NOT Gate] --> Output3[Output: inverse of input]
```

> [!TIP]
> **Example**: An XOR gate is used in adders to sum binary numbers.

## 5. 🏗️ Integrated Circuits

An **Integrated Circuit (IC)** is a collection of many transistors and other components on a single silicon chip.

### Types

- **Analog**: Amplifiers, filters.
- **Digital**: Processors, memory.
- **Mixed-signal**: E.g., ADCs.

### Evolution (Moore's Law)

```mermaid

    Y1960[1960s<br/>Tens of<br/>transistors] --> Y1980[1980s<br/>Thousands of<br/>transistors]
    Y1980 --> Y2000[2000s<br/>Millions of<br/>transistors]
    Y2000 --> Y2020[2020s<br/>Billions of<br/>transistors]
    
    style Y2020 fill:#90EE90
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Moore's Law**: The number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years. Although this trend is slowing down, it has defined computer development for decades.

### Examples

- **Microprocessor**: Contains the ALU, registers, and control units.
- **Memory**: DRAM, SRAM, Flash.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An Intel Core i9 processor is an integrated circuit with ~10 billion transistors on a chip roughly the size of a fingernail!

## Introduction

We live in an **analog** world: light brightness changes smoothly, and a violin's sound flows from note to note.
A computer lives in a **digital** world: it only understands "YES" (1) and "NO" (0).

**Encoding** is the process of turning our smooth, fluid world into clear steps made of zeros and ones.

## 1. ✍️ Text Encoding

How does a computer understand the letter 'A'? It doesn't see a picture of the letter. To a computer, 'A' is just a number in a giant list.

### Step 1: ASCII (Morse Code for Computers)
In the 1960s, engineers agreed:
- Number **65** is 'A'.
- Number **97** is 'a'.
- Number **33** is '!'.

This fit 128 characters total. Enough for English, numbers, and some punctuation, but nothing else.

### Step 2: The Tower of Babel Problem
When computers arrived in Russia, China, and Europe, they ran out of space.
Engineers invented **Unicode** — a massive table with space for EVERY character in the world (over 140,000 symbols), including emojis 🍕.

### Step 3: UTF-8 — Smart Packaging
**UTF-8** is a way to write these numbers into computer memory as efficiently as possible.

| Character | Description | Memory Size | In Bits (Simplified) |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **A** | Latin | 1 byte | `01000001` |
| **Ф** | Cyrillic | 2 bytes | `11010000 10100100` |
| **🍕** | Emoji | 4 bytes | `11110000 10011111 10001101 10010101` |

> [!TIP]
> **Analogy**: Imagine packing a suitcase.
> - Socks ('A') go in a small pocket (1 byte).
> - Shoes ('Ф') go in a larger bag (2 bytes).
> - A coat (Emoji) goes in the main compartment (4 bytes).
> UTF-8 doesn't force you to put socks in a giant suitcase.

## 2. 🖼️ Images and Color

If you look at a screen through a magnifying glass, you'll see millions of tiny colored dots — **pixels**.

### The Color Recipe (RGB)
Every pixel is a "pot" mixing three paints:
- **R** (Red)
- **G** (Green)
- **B** (Blue)

The computer stores a recipe for each pixel: "How much red? How much green?". Values range from **0** (no color) to **255** (maximum).

**Examples:**
- `(255, 0, 0)` -> 🔴 Pure Red
- `(0, 255, 0)` -> 🟢 Pure Green
- `(0, 0, 0)` -> ⚫ Black (lights off)
- `(255, 255, 255)` -> ⚪ White (all lights max)

### YUV: A Video Trick
Storing every video frame in RGB is expensive. Engineers noticed: **our eyes see brightness perfectly, but tiny color details are blurry.**
We split the image into:
- **Y** (Luma) — Black & White version (outlines, brightness). Kept in **high** quality.
- **UV** (Chroma) — Color layer. Compressed 2-4 times more aggressively.

> [!NOTE]
> It's like a coloring book: the outlines are sharp (Y), but the colors might slightly bleed over the lines (UV) — and nobody notices.

## 3. 🔊 Sound: From Wave to Number

Sound is air vibration. How do we record vibrations as numbers?

### Step 1: Microphone
A microphone turns air vibrations into electrical current. Louder sound = higher voltage.

### Step 2: ADC (Sampling)
A chip called an **ADC** measures the voltage level thousands of times per second.

1. **Sampling Rate**: How often we measure.
   - **44,100 times/sec (44.1 kHz)** — Music standard.
   - **Analogy**: Frame rate in movies. If you film too slowly, movement looks jerky.

2. **Bit Depth**: How precise our ruler is.
   - **8-bit** — Ruler with only centimeter marks (old radio sound).
   - **16-bit** — Ruler with micron marks (CD quality).

| Quality | Frequency | Bit Depth | Example |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 📞 Phone | 8 kHz | 8-bit | Voice clear, no music |
| 💿 CD | 44.1 kHz | 16-bit | Perfect for ears |
| 🎬 Studio | 96 kHz | 24-bit | For editing without loss |

## 4. 🎬 Video: The Illusion of Movement

Video is just a very fast sequence of images (frames).

### How to compress video 100x?
If we saved every frame as a full picture, a movie would take 200 GB.
Codecs (compression software) use a trick: **they don't save what doesn't change**.

**Example with a ball on grass:**
1. **Frame 1 (I-Frame)**: We save a full photo of the grass and ball.
2. **Frame 2 (P-Frame)**: The ball moved 1 meter right. Codec writes: *"Take background from last frame, move ball here"*.
3. **Frame 3 (P-Frame)**: Ball moved again. Codec: *"Move ball again"*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **I-frame (Keyframe)**: Full picture. Takes lots of space.
> - **P-frame (Predicted)**: Stores only differences. Takes **very little** space.
> This is why bad internet makes video "glitch": you lost an I-frame and see "differences" applied to the wrong background.

## 🎯 Cheat Sheet

- **Text** = Letter numbers in a table (UTF-8).
- **Image** = Mosaic of pixels (RGB recipes).
- **Sound** = Wave height measurements 44,000 times/sec.
- **Video** = "Keep the background, move the character".

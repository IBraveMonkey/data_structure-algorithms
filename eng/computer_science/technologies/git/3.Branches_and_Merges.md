# 3. 🔀 Branches, Merges, and Conflicts

Branches are considered the "killer feature" of Git. They are incredibly lightweight and allow you to isolate the development of different tasks, keeping the main experimental or stable code independent of new work.

## 1. ⚔️ Merge vs. Rebase

This is a never-ending debate among developers. Both commands achieve the same fundamental goal—incorporating changes from one branch into another—but they do so in very different ways.

### 1.1. Merge
Creates a special **Merge Commit** that has two parent commits.
- **Pros**: Preserves the history in its original form exactly as it happened. It is non-destructive and easy to follow.
- **Cons**: In large projects with many contributors, the history can quickly become a "Gordian Knot" of tangled branches and overlapping lines.

### 1.2. Rebase
Takes your local commits and "re-bases" them on top of a new foundation (the latest commit in the target branch).
- **Pros**: Results in a perfectly linear, clean project history. Reading the `git log` is a streamlined experience.
- **Cons**: It rewrites project history by changing commit hashes. This can be dangerous when working on shared branches.

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Golden Rule of Rebase**: Never rebase a branch that has already been pushed to a public repository. Doing so will break the history for everyone else on your team.

## 2. 🛡️ Conflict Resolution

A conflict occurs when two people modify the **exact same line** in the same file and Git cannot automatically decide which version to keep.

### What it Looks Like:
Git inserts special markers directly into the conflicting file:
```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
My local code (what I currently have)
=======
Incoming code (what is being merged in)
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

### The Resolution Workflow:
1. Open the file containing the conflicts.
2. Manually choose the correct code (or combine both versions).
3. Delete the Git markers (`<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>`).
4. Stage the resolved file: `git add <file>`.
5. Finalize the process: `git commit` (for merge) or `git rebase --continue`.

## 3. 🗺️ Branching Strategies (Git Flow)

To keep teams organized, industry standards for naming and using branches are used:
- `main` / `master`: The branch containing production-ready code.
- `develop`: The primary branch for ongoing work.
- `feature/*`: Specific branches for developing new tasks or features.
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent branches for fixing bugs directly in the production environment.

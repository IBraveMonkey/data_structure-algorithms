# Data Structures and Algorithms (Golang Implementation) & Computer Science (Basics)

LOVE CAPUCCINO, THEY ARE COOL 🐵

This project contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the Go programming language, as well as computer science theory. It serves as a textbook and reference guide for understanding fundamental computer science concepts through practical implementations in Go.

The repository is organized into different sections:

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Various algorithm implementations, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms (some implementations may have gaps)
- **Practical Tasks**: Solutions to common programming problems and interview questions (implementation may have gaps)
- **Theory**: Explanations and documentation of theoretical concepts related to data structures and algorithms - computer science is AWESOME (nope)

Perfect for young idiots (like me), developers (the same thing), and anyone who wants to strengthen their understanding of data structures and algorithms and improve their theoretical knowledge.
The knowledge base will be expanded (of course it won't be), if I find new technologies and something else
